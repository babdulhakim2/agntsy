# Agentsy — Competitive Analysis
*January 2026*

## Market Overview

The "AI agent for creators" space sits at the intersection of three booming markets:
- **Creator Economy** — $250B+ market, 50M+ creators globally
- **AI Assistants** — ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini dominating general-purpose
- **Agentic AI** — Emerging category where AI executes tasks, not just answers questions

**Agentsy's unique angle:** A personal AI agent that *does things* for you — not just chats. Each creator gets an isolated workspace with persistent memory, file management, and tool execution, accessible via WhatsApp/iMessage.
